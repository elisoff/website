I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer living in Vancouver, Canada. I've been developing software for a living for 7+ years.

I realized programming was going to be my job when I wrote my first _hello world_ in a class at my "Informatics Technician" course.
Since then, I learned a lot about what being a Software Engineer is, and I'm on a mission to continue learning every day.

I have experience working in agile environments, working closely with product and design to develop features that combine the right
technical implementations (considering time, cost and benefit) with the best user experience. My primary stack and focus include
**Javascript** (**React** and **Angular**), **NodeJS**, **HTML**, **CSS** (**SASS** and **LESS**), testing with
**Jest**, **Testing Library** and **Enzyme**. A lot of my experience also involves integrating with and developing REST APIs, having
worked in the back-end with languages such as **Python**, **Go**, **Scala** and **PHP**.
